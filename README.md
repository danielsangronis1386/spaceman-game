## 🎮 Game Description
Spaceman Game is a simple browser-based word guessing game with a space theme.  
The player must guess the hidden space-related word by typing letters. Each wrong guess reduces the number of remaining attempts. The goal is to guess the word and save the astronaut from floating forever in space.

I chose this game to practice **DOM manipulation, JavaScript logic, and dynamic UI updates in the browser**, while keeping it fun and engaging with a sci-fi theme.
